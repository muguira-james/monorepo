# A very simple front end

This code is a simple ReactJS front end to fetch data from an API.

The API provides an array of golfers first and last names, their location on the course and an ID

The code uses a react effect hook to do the fetch. Once the effect hook runs it places the array it retrieved from the API into a simple array. That array is shown in an HTML table.

The test is REALLY simple: it just checks to see if a string is present in the output page.
